In August of 2018, Strala announced the availability of  “Strala Data Tracking Platform”.  Strala’s goal was to accurately track the entire consumer experience from start to finish.  The platform would enable users to track marketing and non marketing across multiple channels.  Including systems and media publications.  This was able in integrate data through platforms such as (Web Analytic s, CRM, Advertisement, ESP, CFM, Data Warehouse etc.).  Upon release they offered the service free for 6 months to the first 50 companies that signed up.

"There is a direct relationship between the data marketers need to solve these problems and 'how' and 'what' they track," said Strala co-founder and CEO Mikel Chertudi. "It's true that you can't improve what you don't measure and in the case of marketers, we can't measure if we don't track effectively. Strala is the perfect offering to address this and I'm beyond excited to finally launch and bring our unique solution to marketers."

With this unique approach Strala uses data-driven customer experience to follow all unique touches from the Start to End.  With programs like Touchpoint, JourneyStream and Prism.  It allowed companies to follow and define the data that the company could collect in real time.
